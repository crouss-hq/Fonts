# Font O.D.

### Release Year: 2018
<br>
A series of experimental typefaces designed to test and complement a Font CDN service.
<br><br>
Expect some mistakes and anomalies, though overall the fonts are fairly stable. The OD+ fonts, which were interpretations of the popular styles at the time, tend to be more reliable. That said, proceed with caution.
